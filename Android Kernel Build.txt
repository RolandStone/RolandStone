Here are the general steps to flash a custom kernel to your device:

Boot your device into fastboot mode. This can typically be done by turning off the device and then holding a combination of buttons (e.g. power and volume down) while turning it on.

Connect your device to your development machine via a USB cable.

Verify that fastboot can detect your device by running the command:

Copy code
fastboot devices
Unlock the bootloader of your device if it's locked. This step is not always necessary but it depends on the device and the firmware version.

Flash the kernel image to your device. For example:

Copy code
fastboot flash boot [kernel_image_name.img]
If your kernel source contains modules, you may need to build and flash them separately. You can use the following command to flash them:
Copy code
fastboot flash modules modules.img
Once the kernel image and modules are flashed, you can reboot your device:
Copy code
fastboot reboot
After the device boots up, you should be running your custom kernel.
Note that these steps are general and may vary depending on the device and firmware version. Additionally, flashing a custom kernel may void the warranty of your device, and it is always recommended to backup the device before making any changes.
